# 🎯 Tracking vs Regulation in Control Systems
In Control Theory the problems are broken down to either a **Tracking** or **Regulation** problem. **Tracking** and **Regulation** are two fundamental control objectives, each dealing with different aspects of system performance.

## 🛠️ Regulation: Keeping Things Steady
Regulation ensures that the system's output remains at or returns to a **fixed setpoint**, even in the face of disturbances or unexpected changes (typically in the presence of disturbances or initial conditions).

### 🔍 What is the Goal?  
Minimize the error between the output and a constant reference. Simply put: keep things steady.

### 🌟 Real-World Examples:
- Maintaining a room temperature of **22°C** regardless of outside weather.  
- Keeping a car's speed locked at **60 km/h** on cruise control.

### 📈 Behind the Math:
For a desired setpoint \(r\), the error \(e(t) = y(t) - r\) should approach zero as \(t \to \infty\).

## 🚀 Tracking: Following the Path  
Tracking focuses on ensuring the system's output follows a **time-varying reference signal** with precision.

### 🔍 What is the Goal?  
Minimize the error between the output and a desired trajectory. In simple terms: follow the path.

### 🌟 Real-World Examples:
- A robotic arm tracing a **sinusoidal trajectory**.  
- A drone tailing a moving target or following a preplanned path.

### 📈 Behind the Math:
For a time-varying reference \(r(t)\), the error \(e(t) = y(t) - r(t)\) should approach zero as \(t \to \infty\).

## 🆚 Key Differences: Tracking vs Regulation

| **Feature**           | **Regulation**                       | **Tracking**                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Reference Signal**   | Constant (\(r\))                    | Time-varying (\(r(t)\))               |
| **Objective**          | Maintain steady state output.         | Follow a desired trajectory.          |
| **Example Systems**    | Thermostats, cruise control.          | Path planning, trajectory control.    |
| **Design Focus**       | Reject disturbances effectively.      | Minimize phase/amplitude lag.         |

## ⚡ Practical Examples

### 🎛️ Regulation in Action:
- A motor maintaining a steady speed of **1000 RPM** despite variations in load torque. This requires a robust **regulation** strategy to ensure the speed stays constant.

### 📡 Tracking in Action:
- A quadcopter following a circular trajectory defined as:  
  \[
  x(t) = \cos(t), \quad y(t) = \sin(t)
  \]  
  The system must ensure its position matches this time-varying path with minimal error — making it a classic **tracking** problem.

## 📝 Summary of Problem Types
- **Tracking**: System follows a time-varying reference signal \(r(t)\).  
  > Example: A robot arm mimicking a dancer's movements.  

- **Regulation**: System maintains a fixed reference \(r\).  
  > Example: Keeping your coffee at the perfect drinking temperature.
